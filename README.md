# RHCSA

Red Hat Linux setup:

The recommended requirements for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux for the class include a minimum of 2 GB of RAM to support the graphical user interface, along with 20 GB of disk space. 
Additionally, a network connection and access to an optical drive or a DVD ISO for installation.

Why might a user want to perform custom partitioning during a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation?
Custom partitioning during a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation enables users to create separate partitions for various types of data, including boot files, the root filesystem, swap space, user home directories, log files, and more.
This organization facilitates efficient data management, enhances system performance, and can contribute to improved security by isolating critical system files from user data.

The recommended approach to log into a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server is with a standard user account and only escalate privileges using sudo when administrative tasks require it. 
This approach effectively mitigates security risks and ensures increased control over system access.

Which step is necessary during the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux?

Verifying the wired network connection during the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux is necessary to ensure that the server can obtain an IP address from the DHCP server and establish network connectivity. 
This step is crucial for downloading updates, accessing remote resources, and configuring network settings during and after the installation process.


When using RHEL in the cloud, it is essential to recognize that the boot procedure is managed by the cloud provider rather than by Linux itself. 
Accessing a GRUB boot prompt, which is crucial for troubleshooting and recovery in the RHCSA exam, might be restricted in cloud instances due to the proprietary nature of cloud infrastructure. 
Therefore, relying on cloud instances may not adequately prepare you for the RHCSA exam, where knowledge of boot procedures and troubleshooting is essential.
