WHO:
The who command is used to display information about currently logged-in users,
including their usernames and the terminals they are using. This command provides details such as username, terminal device name (e.g., tty2), login time, and remote host (if applicable). 
It is commonly used to check user activity and monitor active sessions on a Linux system. 

Bash: 
The bash shell is a command line shell that enables users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. 
Operating within a text-based interface, users can execute various commands, run scripts, manage files, and perform various tasks. 
While graphical shells like GNOME may offer additional user-friendly features, the bash shell remains the primary environment for command-line interactions in Linux systems.

The bash shell provides many features to make working with the shell easier, including command-line completion.
This feature helps users by automatically completing commands, file names, and paths as they type, thereby reducing the amount of typing effort required and minimizing errors during command entry.

Within the GNOME graphical environment, you can customize terminal settings by accessing them from the menu bar. Double-clicking on the errors bar and using Ctrl + Shift + allows you to increase the font size for better readability.
After adjusting the font size, you can access terminal settings from the menu bar, typically located under "Preferences" or "Settings."
From there, you can modify various settings including profile preferences, colors, and bell notifications.
